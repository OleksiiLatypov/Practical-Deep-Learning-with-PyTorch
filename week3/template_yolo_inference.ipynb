The key property of this model is that it's **fully convolutional** (doesn't use linear layers), meaning that it can operate with images of any size. The **stride** (reduction factor) of this neural network is 32, meaning that the input image of the shape `[1, 3, 416, 416]` will be transformed to the size of `[1, num_features, 13, 13]`, where $1$ is the batch size, and `num_features` is an output number of channels. We can also interpret the output of a **fully convolutional** network as if it makes a prediction for each 13x13 section of the original image.\n",

So, instead of just sending an image through an entire neural network of a stride 32, `YOLO_v3` has two additional output heads in different parts of the architecture that reduce the image by a factor of 16 and 8, respectively. To sum up, if we have an input image of shape `[1, 3, 416, 416]`, the raw output will be three tensors of shapes `[1, num_features, 13, 13]`, `[1, num_features, 26, 26]`, and `[1, num_features, 52, 52]`. **Note** that each output has the same `num_features`, which is achieved by using 1x1 convolutions to give the output a fixed number of dimensions.\n",

Since the **COCO** dataset has 80 classes, there will be 80 values for class probabilities. This leaves us with an **85** dimensional vector that describes one box prediction. In reality, however, there might be more than one object in each section of an image. So, instead, YOLO_v3 predicts three boxes for each section of an image, resulting in $3 * 85 = 255$ dimensional vector for each section.  \n",
